# Go Google Calendar Converter

## Very specific and narrow use-case with strict parsing. You probably don't need it.

Converts exported .ics from Google Calendar into text, preformatted for Telegram. Used for releases posts on my channel **t.me/tony_tnm**.
Allows to choose source file, year and month. Then organizes entries by categories: shows, movies, games, other.
